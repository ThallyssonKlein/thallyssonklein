> I am a professional driven by purpose (Ikigai). My purpose is to "Solve the most complex problems that exist". This is a constant, it is not an end road, because problems will always exist. That purpose is the basis for every decision I make.

> My [personality](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) is analytical and strategist by nature. Each step has its purpose within my great life strategy. My knowledge model is neither generalist nor specialist, it is T-Shaped and looking to make a transition to Polymath.
